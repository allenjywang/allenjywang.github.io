Hi there! 

I am an incoming PhD student at Inria, funded by MSCA Doctoral Networks. Previously, I was a programmer at Tencent working on game development. I obtained my master degree and bachelor degree from ShanghaiTech University and South China University of Technology, both in Computer Science.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, working out, travelling, writing, and watching game streams. I used to play various games extensively in my young age. Now I'm still a big fan of games, but more as a viewer.
